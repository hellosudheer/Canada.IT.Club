Is there anything called "Canadian Format of Resume"? 

The answer is Yes/No. 

Usually the resumes here are 2 pages or max of 3 pages. Unlike in other places where we have 5-6 pages resume. You may not want to include the details of the tasks you did 10 years back. 

While applying for a job, you need to understand how the selection process happens. 

For e.g. If you are applying through career sits and job board, the most important thing in your resume is the keywords and ATS compliance format. 

If you are applying through a direct referral, long resumes are not preferred. It should be a well laid out resume. 

I usually keep 3 format resumes. 

1. Pure ATS compliance resume. 
2. A word format of the same resume (recruiters usually ask for word format). 
3. A nice looking resume for direct referrals.

You have to use your best judgment on what resume to be used where. Sending a ATS compliance resume directly to a hiring manager may not be a best option.
